### Dr. Mark F. Richardson | Senior Computational Biologist / Bioinformatician

**PhD in Genomics & Bioinformatics**
*Specializing in Statistical Machine Learning, Compositional Data Analysis (CoDa), and Single-Cell and Multi-omics Methodology.*

### 🧬 Research Philosophy: From Method to Mechanism
My methodological work is driven by a fundamental fascination with the **Genotype-to-Phenotype map** and the underlying mechanisms thereof.

I believe that biological complexity — from evolutionary adaptation to disease progression — cannot be understood without rigorous statistical inference. I develop novel computational frameworks not just for the sake of methodology, but to accurately disentangle true biological signals from technical noise in high-dimensional data.

My goal is to build tools and methods to answer complex questions in **cancer biology**, **mental health**, and **evolutionary genomics**.

### 🔭 Current Research & Development
I am currently focusing my methodological research on robust statistical frameworks for high-dimensional, sparse biological data:

*   **[dyprop]:** *("Dynamic Proportionality")* – A novel framework extending CoDa principles to **scRNA-seq**, specifically for trajectory inference and dynamic time-series analysis in sparse datasets.
*   **[dotR]:** – Implementing **Minimum Distance Estimation (MDE)** and 3D regularization algorithms for robust statistical inference.
*   **[propr]:** – (Co-Creator) A standard framework for Compositional Data Analysis in omics.

### 🛠 Technical Stack
*   **Languages:** R (Package Dev), Python, Bash, C++, SQL
*   **Workflow:** Nextflow, Snakemake, Docker/Singularity
*   **Infrastructure:** HPC (Slurm/PBS), AWS, Azure
*   **Focus:** Reproducibility, Unit Testing, Validated Pipelines (GxP)
